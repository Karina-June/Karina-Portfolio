                <th class="aboutMe">I am originally from Minnesota and decided to move to Arizona 4 years ago. As I quickly adapted to the much warmer weather I found out my love for the snow. Luckily, Arizona has all to offer. I am currently enrolled in University of Arizona Coding Boot Camp. I am working towards my full-stack web developer certification. After, my gradution I am still uncertain where I plan on putting down roots. I have always had such a passion for traveling. My hope is to find a career with either traveling or the ability to work from home. I am very excited to see where this career takes me.</th>
